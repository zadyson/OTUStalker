# OTUStalker

OTUStalker is a small software tool designed to be compatible with QIIME (v1.8.0). Its purpose is to retrieve data pertinent to a single taxonomic group, from a larger (presumably mixed) data set, therefore allowing the user to concentrate their efforts on the specific taxa of interest. In effect, OTUStalker is taking the place of a targeted PCR primer set.
OTUStalker requires a number of output files generated by QIIME (v1.8.0), and creates new files allowing re-analysis of the data set using QIIME.
